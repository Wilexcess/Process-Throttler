# Process Throttler

Process Throttler is a simple but powerful lag switch for Windows games and applications. It gives you fine-tuned control over your connection by letting you selectively block internet traffic for a specific program using hotkeys and other activation methods.

## Features

*   **GUI Interface:** Easy-to-use graphical interface. No command-line needed.
*   **Target Any Process:** Find and target any running application by its process name (e.g., `RobloxPlayerBeta.exe`).
*   **Selective Filtering:** Choose to block only `TCP`, `UDP`, or `Both` types of traffic.
*   **Directional Throttling:** Block `Inbound` traffic, `Outbound` traffic, or both.
*   **Instant Toggle:** Use a customizable hotkey to instantly enable or disable the packet drop.
*   **Timed Mode:**
    *   Enable a special mode with its own hotkey.
    *   When this mode is active, your **mouse click** acts as the trigger.
    *   The first click starts a timer; after your chosen delay (in ms), the packet drop activates.
    *   A second click instantly deactivates it..
*   **Dynamic Port Discovery:** Automatically finds the network ports used by the target application and updates them periodically.
*   **Config Saving:** Automatically save options you have entered to an INI file.

## How to Use

1.  **Download:** Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/Wilexcess/Process-Throttler/releases) page and download the latest version.
2.  **Unzip:** Extract the contents of the `.zip` file into a new folder.
4.  **Run as Administrator:** Right-click `ProcessThrottler.exe` and select "Run as administrator". This is required for WinDivert to capture network traffic.
5.  **Configure:**
    *   Enter the process name you want to target.
    *   Set your preferred hotkeys.
    *   Choose your desired settings.
6.  **Start:** Press the "Start" button. The tool will find the process and its ports.
7.  **Toggle:** Use your hotkeys or mouse clicks to control the packet drop!

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "WinDivert failed. Code: 2"

This is the most common issue and is easy to fix. `Error Code 2` means **File Not Found**. It means the program could not find the `WinDivert.sys` driver file.

**Solution:** Ensure that `WinDivert.dll` and `WinDivert.sys` are in the **same directory** as `ProcessThrottler.exe`.

If the problem persists even after placing the files correctly, you may have a "stuck" driver service. To fix this:
1.  Close the Process Throttler application.
2.  Open a **Command Prompt as Administrator**.
3.  Type the following commands, pressing Enter after each one:
    ```cmd
    sc stop WinDivert
    sc delete WinDivert
    ```
4.  **Reboot your computer.** This is a critical step. (Note: sometimes it may work without a reboot)
5.  After rebooting, try running Process Throttler again (as administrator).

## Building from Source

## üõ†Ô∏è If You Want to Build the Project Yourself

To compile and run the project manually, follow these steps:

### ‚úÖ Environment
- Use **Visual Studio 2019** or **2022** (Community Edition is fine).
- Make sure the **"Desktop Development with C++"** workload is installed.  
  You can add it via the Visual Studio Installer if needed.

### üì¶ WinDivert SDK
1. Download the latest WinDivert SDK from:  
   https://reqrypt.org/windivert.html

2. From the extracted SDK, copy the following files into your project folder:
   - `include/windivert.h` ‚Üí put it in an `include/` folder inside your project.
   - `x64/WinDivert.lib` or `x86/WinDivert.lib` ‚Üí put it in a `lib/` folder.
   - `x64/WinDivert.dll` or `x86/WinDivert.dll` ‚Üí place next to your `.exe` after build (i.e., in `Debug/` or `Release/`).

3. Make sure the architecture of the `.lib` and `.dll` (x64 or x86) matches your project‚Äôs target platform.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Visual Studio Configuration

#### VC++ Directories:
- **Include Directories**:  
  ```
  $(ProjectDir)include
  ```
- **Library Directories**:  
  ```
  $(ProjectDir)lib
  ```

#### Linker ‚Üí Input ‚Üí Additional Dependencies:
Add the following libraries:
```
WinDivert.lib
ws2_32.lib
iphlpapi.lib
```

These are required for packet interception and network API support.

### üß™ Final Notes:
- Run Visual Studio as **Administrator**, or opening a WinDivert handle will fail with error code 5.
- Ensure the `WinDivert.dll` and `WinDivert64.sys` are next to your compiled `.exe` at runtime.
- Always match the **platform target** (x64/x86) with the version of `WinDivert.lib` and `WinDivert.dll` you‚Äôre using.
